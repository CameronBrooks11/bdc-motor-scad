This isn't particularly modular or reusable, you have to edit the script to
set parameters. I couldn't be bothered coming up with a sensible way to load
the measurement configuration in openscad and didn't have a different shaped
motor to do tests with anyway.

May optionally generate axle as separate part separated by tiny sleeve hollow.

May optionally generate masking-out blocks for wiring, in case you're
subtracting this model from another one like I did.
